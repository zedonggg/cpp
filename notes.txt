**Good practice**  
- Use the debug build configuration when developing a program.
- When ready to release the executable to others or test performance, use the release build configuration.


- Disable compiler extensions to ensure programs remain complaint with C++ standards and are compatible with any system
- Compiler extensions are usually not necessary
